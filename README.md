# PlasticTest
-Sorry for the unnecessary files in the project, I have my template project based on clean archeticture which I use for new projects
-The animation of the square should have been done on the custom view itself given it's updated pivot, I didn't have the time to do so
-I am calling the api every 10 milliseconds instead of 1 ms as the performance was not stable, I yet to solve that matter
-I really enjoyed working on this test, It motivated me to learn some new things and reminded me of what I should be learning going forward

Thank you for opportunity :)
